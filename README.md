# AdvancedEncryptionStandard

As outlined in the following document:

http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf

This is an AES implementation of the government standard of AES as defined by the document above.
The program currently has some issues with file input and output (because of the way bytes are stored in AES).
To run the program run python AES.py and the main function will be called. 

If using a file use run_aes.
If using user input use run_aes_input
